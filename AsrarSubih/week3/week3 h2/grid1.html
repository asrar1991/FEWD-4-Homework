        <h2> about his life</h2>
        Born in a village of the Ottoman-ruled Mount
         Lebanon Mutasarrifate to a Maronite Christian family, 
         the young Gibran immigrated with his mother and siblings to the United States in 1895.
          As his mother worked as a seamstress, 
          <br>
          As his mother worked as a seamstress, he was enrolled at a school in Boston, where his creative abilities were quickly noticed by a teacher who presented him to Fred Holland Day. Gibran was sent back to his native land by his family at the age of fifteen to enroll at the Coll√®ge de la Sagesse in Beirut. Returning to Boston upon his youngest sister's death in 1902, he lost his older half-brother and his mother the following year, seemingly relying afterwards on his remaining sister's income from her work at a dressmaker's shop for some time.

            <h2> some of his Quotes</h2>
        <p>
            " If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, 
            
            they were always yours. If they don't, they never were."
            &nbsp;
            <br>
           &nbsp;
          " One day you will ask me which is more important? My life
     or yours? I will say mine and you will walk away not knowing 
      that you are my life." 
      &nbsp;
      <br>
     
            "Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself"
            &nbsp;
            <br>
            "I have found both freedom and safety in my madness; the freedom of loneliness and the safety from being understood, for those who understand us enslave something in us."
